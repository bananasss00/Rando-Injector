## Changes
**It has been edited to include interactive mode (you provide process name and DLL name on the go, not hardcoding it).**  

## How to compile?
### Clean version
Just open it in VS2017/2019 and build it (Windows 10 SDK 18362, Platform Toolkit v142)

### Bloated version
1) Change all bytes (0x00, 0x01, 0x03....) in define "JUNKS" to random bytes
2) Change size of this block by adding new bytes
3) Compile (VS2017/2019 - `F9` or `Ctrl+Shift+B`)
