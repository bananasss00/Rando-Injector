# Rando-Injector

## It has been edited to include interactive mode (you provide process name and dll name on the go, not hardcoding it) - that's the only change.

## How to compile?
1) Change all bytes(0x00, 0x01, 0x03....) in define "JUNKS" to random bytes
2) Change size this block by add new bytes
3) Compile this
